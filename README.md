# NLP Catch-up 01

## Introduction & Context

Greetings, thanks for according me the chance of catching up both my grade and my notions.

In truth, I couldn't assist to most of the NLP classes (among others) due to some problems getting me out of school for a while. I still got interested in NLP and those last few weeks were a great catch up, I actually had fun training my models and expanding knowledge (got deep into it!).

You were not lying when you said 8 to 12 hours, I actually completed it in a less than a week with only evening from workdays. You have my gratitude.

## Delivery

You will find two reports available in this repository, as well as the source notebook :

* **REPORT_CU1_CODE** : Standard notebook.ipynb export with *nbconvert*.
* **REPORT_CU2_NOCODE** : Same as above, but with no code displayed (for an easier read).
* **catch_up_01.ipynb** : Source notebook, my actual recommendation if you want to see how I did things and you got a good viewer for it.

Things could probably be polished up a bit more in term of presentation, but I typed, explained and documented everything as asked in the subject.

Hopefully this will both satisfy you and prove that the notions pf the course have been understood and assimilated.

## Setting up the environment

Conda has been used to package the python environment.
It can be loaded using the following command :

```sh
conda env create -n Catch-up --file environment.yml
```

However the environment.yml file is pretty standard, so you could use your favorite pyenv manager to do so if you please.
